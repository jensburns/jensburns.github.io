Consistency is crucial to establishing trust with your site’s visitors.

If your website content is error-free, factually accurate and adheres to a consistent writing style, then you have a much better chance of really connecting with your audience. Don’t let a bunch of typos get in the way.

## Proofreading service
I’ll comb through all of your website text, doing things like:

- Fixing grammar, spelling and punctuation issues
- Highlighting any inconsistencies
- Making sure the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)
- Making sure the text adheres to accessibility best practice

## Editing service
I’ll carry out all of the above, plus:

- Flag jargon your audience might not understand
- Highlight any factual inaccuracies
- Suggest improvements to your text (including where to make it more concise)
- Suggest ways to improve your SEO (search engine optimisation)

## Don’t have a style guide?
No worries. With both services, you’ll get a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made, text-wise (like using 16:00 instead of 4 p.m., for example).

The style sheet helps to establish consistency on your website – and any other communications you create.

And it’s something you can use down the line if you ever wanted to expand on it to create a house style guide of your own.

## How it works
We’ll go through your site’s goals and your audience, which’ll help me review the content from their point of view.

And then you’ll send over the text in a Google Doc, Word Doc, ideally. I’ll then go through it using tracked changes, adding comments when I come across anything I want to flag with you.

If the content is already in your CMS, then we can talk about the best way of getting it into a format I can edit.

The whole process can take anywhere from two days to two weeks, depending on how big your site is.
