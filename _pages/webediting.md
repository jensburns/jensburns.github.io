I can edit your website text or proofread your site once it's built, so you can be sure your messaging is getting through to your visitors in a clear, accurate and consistent way.

Consistency is crucial to establishing trust with your site’s visitors. If your website's content adheres to a set of writing rules and is as error-free as possible, then you have a much better chance of really connecting with your audience. Don’t let a bunch of typos get in the way.

With 15 years' experience working in digital communications, I know what to look out for.

## Editing your website's text  
I’ll review your content and:

- Fix grammar, spelling and punctuation errors
- Flag jargon your audience might not understand
- Highlight any inconsistencies
- Note any factual inaccuracies
- Suggest improvements to your text (like where to make it more concise or opportunities to link to other content)
- Make sure the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)

## Proofreading your website
This is sometimes called a QA (quality assurance) – this is a final check of your website. This process normally takes place once your site has been created, but not yet launched.

I can comb through your web pages and do things like:

- Check for any spelling, grammar and punctuation errors
- Highlight any inconsistencies
- Flag any common accessibility issues
- Click on links to make sure they work
- Note any issues with layout, images or text alignment  

I can review your website in more than one browser, if need be. (Sometimes, the pages can display differently in Chrome than, say, Safari. It's always worth double-checking before your site goes live.)

## Don’t have a style guide?
No worries. With both services, you’ll get a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made, text-wise (like using 16:00 instead of 4 p.m., for example).

The style sheet helps to establish consistency on your website – and any other communications you create.

And you can use it down the line if you ever wanted to expand on it to create a writing style guide of your own.

## How it works
If it's an editing project, then I'll usually work in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. I'll always use tracked changes and add in comments when I come across anything I want to flag with you.

If it's a proofreading project, then I'd normally review it in a browser. I'll keep track of any errors or suggested changes in a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets).

But I'm flexible – if none of these work for you, then we can discuss other options before the project starts.
