description: For more than 15 years, I've edited and proofread all kinds of writing, from website text, reports and articles to courses, policies and newsletters.

A Miami Herald columnist at 16, I went on to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Florida.

After I moved to the United Kingdom in 2005, my work expanded to include editing and writing communications for the private and public sectors – and everything in between. I’ve worked with Cardiff University, Middlesex University, UWE Bristol, Office for National Statistics, National Strategies, Skills for Health and WikiJob, among others.

> Being a writer makes me a better editor and proofreader – it means I understand the importance of revision and respect the writer’s voice when I’m editing.

[My articles, short stories and humour pieces](/writing) have appeared in online and print publications both in the US and UK, including Slate and Stylist

Beyond editing and proofreading, I also bring project management skills and the flexibility to work independently or as part of a team. I'm well-versed in using content management systems (WordPress, Squiz, DatoCMS, Tridion) and Markdown too.  

I believe in working with my clients in an open and honest manner, offering experience and advice where I can – and learning from them in equal measure.

And I’ve never failed to meet a deadline. So what needs to get done gets done, on time.
