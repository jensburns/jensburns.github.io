description: Make your writing as effective, consistent and error-free as possible with my professional copyediting service.
---
Whether your project calls for a light edit or a heavier one, I’m all about making your words as effective, consistent and error-free as possible – while keeping your voice and style of writing intact.

It all helps to build trust with your reader and establish you as an expert.

For more than 15 years, I’ve edited wide selection of text, including articles, blog posts, policies, newsletters, courses, reports, prospectuses, presentations and [website content](/website-editing-and-proofreading).

[I'm a writer](/writing), too. So I know how crucial the revision process is, and it means I always respect the writer's voice when I'm editing. (Just like I expect other editors to do for my work!)

## Copyediting service
I’ll review your text and check:

- it’s free from punctuation, grammar and spelling errors
- punctuation, capitalisation, hyphenation and spelling are consistent throughout
- there’s no unnecessary repetition
- the tense and tone are consistent
- it’s the appropriate writing style for your audience
- there aren’t any contradictions or other inconsistencies
- your intended message is communicated as clearly as possible
- the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)  

If you also need me to carry out any fact checking, just let me know before the work starts.

### Reviewing translated content
If your writing has been translated into English (by a linguist or via Google Translate or DeepL), and you want a second pair of eyes on it, I can help with that too.

### Don’t have a style guide?
It's never a problem. I'll give you a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made as I was going through your text (like using 11:00 p.m. instead of 23:00, for example).

Using a style sheet helps to make a piece of writing consistent. And you or your organisation can use it down the line if you ever wanted to create a style guide of your own.

## How it works
Usually the copyediting process takes place prior to proofreading, which is the final check before a piece of writing is set free.

Depending on the project, my help can be enlisted fairly early on in the process or just before a piece is signed off (for more of a 'proof-editing'). I don’t have any hard or fast rules about it, and I’m happy to work with you to fit your, or your organisation’s, workflow.

I normally edit in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, using track changes and comments to make suggestions or ask questions. I can also edit straight into PowerPoint presentations or content management systems (CMS), if that’s easier for you.

## Using British, American or Canadian English
As an American based in the UK, I can effortlessly work in both American and British English.

So if you need to rework your communications written in American English for a British audience, or vice versa, I can help. I also have experience editing copy in Canadian English.
