I"È<p>Whether your project calls for a light edit or a heavier one, Iâ€™m all about making your words as effective, consistent and error-free as possible â€“ while keeping your voice and style of writing intact.</p>

<p>It all helps to build trust with your reader and establish you as an expert.</p>

<p>For more than 15 years, Iâ€™ve edited wide selection of text, including articles, blog posts, policies, newsletters, courses, reports, prospectuses, presentations and <a href="/contact">website content</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/writing">Iâ€™m a writer</a>, too. So I know how crucial the revision process is, and it means I always respect the writerâ€™s voice when Iâ€™m editing. (Just like I expect other editors to do for my work!)</p>

<h2 id="copyediting-service">Copyediting service</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ll review your text and check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>itâ€™s free from punctuation, grammar and spelling errors</li>
  <li>punctuation, capitalisation, hyphenation and spelling are consistent throughout</li>
  <li>thereâ€™s no unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>the tense and tone are consistent</li>
  <li>itâ€™s the appropriate writing style for your audience</li>
  <li>there arenâ€™t any contradictions or other inconsistencies</li>
  <li>your intended message is communicated as clearly as possible</li>
  <li>the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you also need me to carry out any fact checking, just let me know before the work starts.</p>

<h3 id="reviewing-translated-content">Reviewing translated content</h3>
<p>If your writing has been translated into English (by a linguist or via Google Translate or DeepL), and you want a second pair of eyes on it, I can help with that too.</p>

<h3 id="dont-have-a-style-guide">Donâ€™t have a style guide?</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s never a problem. Iâ€™ll give you a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made as I was going through your text (like using 11:00 p.m. instead of 23:00, for example).</p>

<p>Using a style sheet helps to make a piece of writing consistent. And you or your organisation can use it down the line if you ever wanted to create a style guide of your own.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Usually the copyediting process takes place prior to proofreading, which is the final check before a piece of writing is set free.</p>

<p>Depending on the project, my help can be enlisted fairly early on in the process or just before a piece is signed off (for more of a â€˜proof-editingâ€™). I donâ€™t have any hard or fast rules about it, and Iâ€™m happy to work with you to fit your, or your organisationâ€™s, workflow.</p>

<p>I normally edit in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, using track changes and comments to make suggestions or ask questions. I can also edit straight into PowerPoint presentations or content management systems (CMS), if thatâ€™s easier for you.</p>

<h2 id="using-british-american-or-canadian-english">Using British, American or Canadian English</h2>
<p>As an American based in the UK, I can effortlessly work in both American and British English.</p>

<p>So if you need to rework your communications written in American English for a British audience, or vice versa, I can help. I also have experience editing copy in Canadian English.</p>
