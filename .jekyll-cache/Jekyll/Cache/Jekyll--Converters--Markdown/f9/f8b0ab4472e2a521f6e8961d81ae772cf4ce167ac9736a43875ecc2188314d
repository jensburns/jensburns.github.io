I"<p>I can edit your website text or proofread your site once it’s built, so you can be sure your messaging is getting through to your visitors in a clear, accurate and consistent way.</p>

<p>Consistency is crucial to establishing trust with your site’s visitors. If your website’s content adheres to a set of writing rules and is as error-free as possible, then you have a much better chance of really connecting with your audience. Don’t let a bunch of typos get in the way.</p>

<p>With 15 years’ experience working in digital communications, I know what to look out for.</p>

<h2 id="editing-your-websites-text">Editing your website’s text</h2>
<p>I’ll review your content and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix grammar, spelling and punctuation errors</li>
  <li>Flag jargon your audience might not understand</li>
  <li>Highlight any inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Note any factual inaccuracies</li>
  <li>Suggest improvements to your text (like where to make it more concise or opportunities to link to other content)</li>
  <li>Make sure the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="proofreading-your-website">Proofreading your website</h2>
<p>This is sometimes called a QA (quality assurance) – this is a final check of your website. This process normally takes place once your site has been created, but not yet launched.</p>

<p>I can comb through your web pages and do things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check for any spelling, grammar and punctuation errors</li>
  <li>Highlight any inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Flag any common accessibility issues</li>
  <li>Click on links to make sure they work</li>
  <li>Note any issues with layout, images or text alignment</li>
</ul>

<p>I can review your website in more than one browser, if need be. (Sometimes, the pages can display differently in Chrome than, say, Safari. It’s always worth double-checking before your site goes live.)</p>

<h2 id="dont-have-a-style-guide">Don’t have a style guide?</h2>
<p>No worries. With both services, you’ll get a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made, text-wise (like using 16:00 instead of 4 p.m., for example).</p>

<p>The style sheet helps to establish consistency on your website – and any other communications you create.</p>

<p>And you can use it down the line if you ever wanted to expand on it to create a writing style guide of your own.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>If it’s an editing project, then I’ll usually work in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. I’ll always use tracked changes and add in comments when I come across anything I want to flag with you.</p>

<p>If it’s a proofreading project, then I’d normally review it in a browser. I’ll keep track of any errors or suggested changes in a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets).</p>

<p>But I’m flexible – if none of these work for you, then we can discuss other options before the project starts.</p>
