I"d<p>I’ve worked with a wide selection of text, including articles, blog posts, policies, newsletters, courses, reports, prospectuses, presentations and website content.</p>

<p>Whether the project calls for a light edit or a heavier one, I’m all about making your words as effective, consistent and error-free as possible – while keeping your voice and style of writing intact. It helps to build trust with your readers, while establishing your expertise.</p>

<h2 id="copyediting-service">Copyediting service</h2>

<p>I’ll review your text and make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s free from grammar, punctuation and spelling errors</li>
  <li>punctuation, capitalisation, hyphenation and spelling are consistent throughout</li>
  <li>there’s no unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>the language, tone of voice and tense are consistent</li>
  <li>it’s the appropriate writing style for your audience</li>
  <li>there aren’t any contradictions or other inconsistencies</li>
  <li>your intended message is communicated as clearly as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>I can also be on the lookout for any fact errors, if need be.</p>

<p>If your writing has been translated into English using Google Translate or DeepL, and you want a second pair of eyes on it
to make it sound less robotic, I can help with that too.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Usually the copyediting process takes place just prior to proofreading, which is the final check before a piece of writing is set free.</p>

<p>(Depending on the project, my help can be enlisted fairly early on in the process or just before a piece is signed off. I don’t have any hard or fast rules about it, and I’m happy to work with you to fit your, or your organisation’s, workflow.)</p>

<p>We’ll have a chat about how I can help, your writing’s intentions and your audience, and if I’m a good fit for your project, we’ll go from there.</p>

<p>I normally edit in Google Docs or Word, using track changes and comments to make suggestions or ask questions. I can also edit straight into PowerPoint presentations or content management systems (CMS), if that’s easier for you.</p>

<h2 id="using-british-american-or-canadian-english">Using British, American or Canadian English</h2>

<p>As an American based in the UK, I can effortlessly work in both American and British English.</p>

<p>So if you need to rework your communications written in American English for a British audience, or vice versa, I can help. I also have experience editing copy in Canadian English.</p>
