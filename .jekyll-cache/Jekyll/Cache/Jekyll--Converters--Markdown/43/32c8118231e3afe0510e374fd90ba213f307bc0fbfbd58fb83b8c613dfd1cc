I"<p>Consistency is crucial to establishing trust with your site’s visitors.</p>

<p>If your website content is error-free, factually accurate and adheres to a consistent writing style, then you have a much better chance of really connecting with your audience. Don’t let a bunch of typos get in the way.</p>

<h2 id="proofreading-service">Proofreading service</h2>
<p>I’ll comb through all of your website text, doing things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing grammar, spelling and punctuation issues</li>
  <li>Highlighting any inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Making sure the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)</li>
  <li>Making sure the text adheres to accessibility best practice</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="editing-service">Editing service</h2>
<p>I’ll carry out all of the above, plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flag jargon your audience might not understand</li>
  <li>Highlight any factual inaccuracies</li>
  <li>Suggest improvements to your text (including where to make it more concise)</li>
  <li>Suggest ways to improve your SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dont-have-a-style-guide">Don’t have a style guide?</h2>
<p>No worries. With both services, you’ll get a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made, text-wise (like using 16:00 instead of 4 p.m., for example).</p>

<p>The style sheet helps to establish consistency on your website – and any other communications you create.</p>

<p>And it’s something you can use down the line if you ever wanted to expand on it to create a house style guide of your own.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>We’ll go through your site’s goals and your audience, which’ll help me review the content from their point of view.</p>

<p>And then you’ll send over the text in a Google Doc, Word Doc, ideally. I’ll then go through it using tracked changes, adding comments when I come across anything I want to flag with you.</p>

<p>If the content is already in your CMS, then we can talk about the best way of getting it into a format I can edit.</p>

<p>The whole process can take anywhere from two days to two weeks, depending on how big your site is.</p>
