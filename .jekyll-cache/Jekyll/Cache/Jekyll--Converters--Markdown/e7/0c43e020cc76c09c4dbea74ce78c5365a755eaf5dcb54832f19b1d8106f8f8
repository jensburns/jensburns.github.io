I"_<p>A Miami Herald columnist at 16, I went on to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Florida.</p>

<p>After I moved to the United Kingdom in 2005, my work expanded to include editing and writing communications for the private and public sectors – and everything in between. I’ve worked with Cardiff University, Middlesex University, UWE Bristol, Office for National Statistics, National Strategies, Skills for Health and WikiJob, among others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being a writer makes me a better editor and proofreader – it means I understand the importance of revision and respect the writer’s voice when I’m editing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/writing">My articles, short stories and humour pieces</a> have appeared in online and print publications both in the US and UK, including Slate and Stylist</p>

<p>Beyond editing and proofreading, I also bring project management skills and the flexibility to work independently or as part of a team. I’m well-versed in using content management systems (WordPress, Squiz, DatoCMS, Tridion) and Markdown too.</p>

<p>I believe in working with my clients in an open and honest manner, offering experience and advice where I can – and learning from them in equal measure.</p>

<p>And I’ve never failed to meet a deadline. So what needs to get done gets done, on time.</p>
