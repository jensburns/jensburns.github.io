I"Ô<p>Consistency is crucial to establishing trust with your siteâ€™s visitors.</p>

<p>If your website content is error-free, factually accurate and adheres to a consistent writing style, then you have a much better chance of really connecting with your audience. Donâ€™t let a bunch of typos get in the way.</p>

<h1 id="proofreading-service">Proofreading service</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ll comb through all of your website text, doing things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing grammar, spelling and punctuation issues</li>
  <li>Highlighting any inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Making sure the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)</li>
  <li>Making sure the text adheres to accessibility best practice</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="editing-service">Editing service</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ll carry out all of the above, plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flag jargon your audience might not understand</li>
  <li>Highlight any factual inaccuracies</li>
  <li>Suggest improvements to your text (including where to make it more concise)</li>
  <li>Suggest ways to improve your SEO (search engine optimisation)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="dont-have-a-style-guide">Donâ€™t have a style guide?</h1>
<p>No worries. With both services, youâ€™ll get a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made, text-wise (like using 16:00 instead of 4 p.m., for example).</p>

<p>The style sheet helps to establish consistency on your website â€“ and any other communications you create.</p>

<p>And itâ€™s something you can use down the line if you ever wanted to expand on it to create a house style guide of your own.</p>

<h1 id="how-it-works">How it works</h1>
<p>Weâ€™ll go through your siteâ€™s goals and your audience, whichâ€™ll help me review the content from their point of view.</p>

<p>And then youâ€™ll send over the text in a Google Doc, Word Doc, ideally. Iâ€™ll then go through it using tracked changes, adding comments when I come across anything I want to flag with you.</p>

<p>If the content is already in your CMS, then we can talk about the best way of getting it into a format I can edit.</p>

<p>The whole process can take anywhere from two days to two weeks, depending on how big your site is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>â€‹â€™As a web editor, Jen edited content for the Universityâ€™s website, making sure it adhered to accessibility, house style and SEO standards.</p>

<p>Jen was a respected and hard working member of the team.â€‹â€™</p>

<p>â€‹- Matt Owen, Digital Marketing Manager, UWE Bristol â€‹</p>

<p>â€˜Jen is extremely motivated â€“ a real go-getter â€“ which allowed her to hit the ground running on a very challenging project.</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm is infectious and my only wish is that weâ€™d got her on the team sooner! It was a pleasure working with her.â€™</p>

  <li>Gail Davidson, Web Writing Manager, National Strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked with a wide selection of text, including articles, blog posts, policies, newsletters, courses, reports, prospectuses, presentations and website content.</p>

<p>Whether the project calls for a light edit or a heavier one, Iâ€™m all about making your words as effective, consistent and error-free as possible â€“ while keeping your voice and style of writing intact. It helps to build trust with your readers, while establishing your expertise.</p>

<h2 id="copyediting-service">Copyediting service</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ll review your text and make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>itâ€™s free from grammar, punctuation and spelling errors</li>
  <li>punctuation, capitalisation, hyphenation and spelling are consistent throughout</li>
  <li>thereâ€™s no unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>the language, tone of voice and tense are consistent</li>
  <li>itâ€™s the appropriate writing style for your audience</li>
  <li>there arenâ€™t any contradictions or other inconsistencies</li>
  <li>your intended message is communicated as clearly as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>I can also be on the lookout for any fact errors, if need be.</p>

<p>If your writing has been translated into English using Google Translate or DeepL, and you want a second pair of eyes on it
to make it sound less robotic, I can help with that too.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works-1">How it works</h2>

<p>Usually the copyediting process takes place just prior to proofreading, which is the final check before a piece of writing is set free.</p>

<p>(Depending on the project, my help can be enlisted fairly early on in the process or just before a piece is signed off. I donâ€™t have any hard or fast rules about it, and Iâ€™m happy to work with you to fit your, or your organisationâ€™s, workflow.)</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll have a chat about how I can help, your writingâ€™s intentions and your audience, and if Iâ€™m a good fit for your project, weâ€™ll go from there.</p>

<p>I normally edit in Google Docs or Word, using track changes and comments to make suggestions or ask questions. I can also edit straight into PowerPoint presentations or content management systems (CMS), if thatâ€™s easier for you.</p>

<h2 id="using-british-american-or-canadian-english">Using British, American or Canadian English</h2>

<p>As an American based in the UK, I can effortlessly work in both American and British English.</p>

<p>So if you need to rework your communications written in American English for a British audience, or vice versa, I can help. I also have experience editing copy in Canadian English.</p>
