I"*<p>Consistency is crucial to establishing trust with your site’s visitors.</p>

<p>If your website content is error-free, factually accurate and adheres to a consistent writing style, then you have a much better chance of really connecting with your audience. Don’t let a bunch of typos get in the way.</p>

<h1 id="proofreading-service">Proofreading service</h1>
<p>I’ll comb through all of your website text, doing things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing grammar, spelling and punctuation issues</li>
  <li>Highlighting any inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Making sure the text aligns with your style guide (if you have one)</li>
  <li>Making sure the text adheres to accessibility best practice</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="editing-service">Editing service</h1>
<p>I’ll carry out all of the above, plus:</p>

<p>Flag jargon your audience might not understand
Highlight any factual inaccuracies
Suggest improvements to your text (including where to make it more concise)
Suggest ways to improve your SEO (search engine optimisation)
Don’t have a style guide?
No worries. With both services, you’ll get a style sheet, which outlines all the decisions I made, text-wise (like using 16:00 instead of 4 p.m., for example).</p>

<p>The style sheet helps to establish consistency on your website – and any other communications you create.</p>

<p>Andit’s something you can use down the line if you ever wanted to expand on it to create a house style guide of your own.
How it works
We’ll go through your site’s goals and your audience, which’ll help me review the content from their point of view.</p>

<p>And then you’ll send over the text in a Google Doc, Word Doc, ideally. I’ll then go through it using tracked changes, adding comments when I come across anything I want to flag with you.</p>

<p>If the content is already in your CMS, then we can talk about the best way of getting it into a format I can edit.</p>

<p>The whole process can take anywhere from two days to two weeks, depending on how big your site is.

<p>​’As a web editor, Jen edited content for the University’s website, making sure it adhered to accessibility, house style and SEO standards.</p>

<p>Jen was a respected and hard working member of the team.​’</p>

<p>​- Matt Owen, Digital Marketing Manager, UWE Bristol ​</p>

<p>‘Jen is extremely motivated – a real go-getter – which allowed her to hit the ground running on a very challenging project.</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm is infectious and my only wish is that we’d got her on the team sooner! It was a pleasure working with her.’</p>

  <li>Gail Davidson, Web Writing Manager, National Strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve worked with a wide selection of text, including articles, blog posts, policies, newsletters, courses, reports, prospectuses, presentations and website content.</p>

<p>Whether the project calls for a light edit or a heavier one, I’m all about making your words as effective, consistent and error-free as possible – while keeping your voice and style of writing intact. It helps to build trust with your readers, while establishing your expertise.</p>

<h2 id="copyediting-service">Copyediting service</h2>

<p>I’ll review your text and make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s free from grammar, punctuation and spelling errors</li>
  <li>punctuation, capitalisation, hyphenation and spelling are consistent throughout</li>
  <li>there’s no unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>the language, tone of voice and tense are consistent</li>
  <li>it’s the appropriate writing style for your audience</li>
  <li>there aren’t any contradictions or other inconsistencies</li>
  <li>your intended message is communicated as clearly as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>I can also be on the lookout for any fact errors, if need be.</p>

<p>If your writing has been translated into English using Google Translate or DeepL, and you want a second pair of eyes on it
to make it sound less robotic, I can help with that too.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Usually the copyediting process takes place just prior to proofreading, which is the final check before a piece of writing is set free.</p>

<p>(Depending on the project, my help can be enlisted fairly early on in the process or just before a piece is signed off. I don’t have any hard or fast rules about it, and I’m happy to work with you to fit your, or your organisation’s, workflow.)</p>

<p>We’ll have a chat about how I can help, your writing’s intentions and your audience, and if I’m a good fit for your project, we’ll go from there.</p>

<p>I normally edit in Google Docs or Word, using track changes and comments to make suggestions or ask questions. I can also edit straight into PowerPoint presentations or content management systems (CMS), if that’s easier for you.</p>

<h2 id="using-british-american-or-canadian-english">Using British, American or Canadian English</h2>

<p>As an American based in the UK, I can effortlessly work in both American and British English.</p>

<p>So if you need to rework your communications written in American English for a British audience, or vice versa, I can help. I also have experience editing copy in Canadian English.</p>
