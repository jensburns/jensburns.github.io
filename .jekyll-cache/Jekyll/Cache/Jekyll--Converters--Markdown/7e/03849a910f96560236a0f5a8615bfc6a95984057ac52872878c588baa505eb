I"Î<p>Iâ€™ve worked with a wide selection of text, including articles, blog posts, policies, newsletters, courses, reports, prospectuses, presentations and website content.</p>

<p>Whether the project calls for a light edit or a heavier one, Iâ€™m all about making your words as effective, consistent and error-free as possible â€“ while keeping your voice and style of writing intact. It helps to build trust with your readers, while establishing your expertise.</p>

<h2 id="copyediting-service">Copyediting service</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ll review your text and make sure:</p>

<p>itâ€™s free from grammar, punctuation and spelling errors
punctuation, capitalisation, hyphenation and spelling are consistent throughout
thereâ€™s no unnecessary repetition
the language, tone of voice and tense are consistent
itâ€™s the appropriate writing style for your audience
there arenâ€™t any contradictions or other inconsistencies
your intended message is communicated as clearly as possible</p>

<p>I can also be on the lookout for any fact errors, if need be.</p>

<p>If your writing has been translated into English using Google Translate or DeepL, and you want a second pair of eyes on it
to make it sound less robotic, I can help with that too.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Usually the copyediting process takes place just prior to proofreading, which is the final check before a piece of writing is set free.</p>

<p>(Depending on the project, my help can be enlisted fairly early on in the process or just before a piece is signed off. I donâ€™t have any hard or fast rules about it, and Iâ€™m happy to work with you to fit your, or your organisationâ€™s, workflow.)</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll have a chat about how I can help, your writingâ€™s intentions and your audience, and if Iâ€™m a good fit for your project, weâ€™ll go from there.</p>

<p>I normally edit in Google Docs or Word, using track changes and comments to make suggestions or ask questions. I can also edit straight into PowerPoint presentations or content management systems (CMS), if thatâ€™s easier for you.</p>

<h2 id="using-british-american-or-canadian-english">Using British, American or Canadian English</h2>

<p>As an American based in the UK, I can effortlessly work in both American and British English.</p>

<p>So if you need to rework your communications written in American English for a British audience, or vice versa, I can help. I also have experience editing copy in Canadian English.
